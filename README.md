RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Hybrid Retrieval



This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a combination of vector-based and sparse retrieval methods. The system utilizes Chroma for vector-based retrieval and BM25 for sparse retrieval, providing a robust hybrid retrieval mechanism for better context-aware responses.
